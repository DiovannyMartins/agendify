// Server-side retrieval of the owner's agenda export (Pro feature, ADR 0008). It

// sees the feed. The gate + serialisation live in the pure module; this file is
// only the boundary that fetches. The deps are injectable so the boundary can be
// exercised with a real user-scoped client (RLS) in the integration tests, and
// with the data the agenda page already loaded.
